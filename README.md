## What I Learned

- **Data Acquisition**  
  Learned to load, access, and parse datasets using Python tools and libraries.
  
- **Basic Data Exploration**  
  Understood how to generate summaries, identify data types, and detect missing values.
  
- **Data Wrangling**  
  Cleaned and transformed data using `Pandas`, reshaped datasets, and performed feature engineering.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualized data distributions and relationships using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.

- **Model Development**  
  Built regression models to predict outcomes and analyze model behavior.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Applied metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ² to evaluate model performance and accuracy.
